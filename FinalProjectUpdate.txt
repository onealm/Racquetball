Assignment 3 Final Project Update:

We thought networking would take less time, and it would have,
if not for the fact that we tried to use Wade's SDL_Net wrapper.
We spent numerous days trying to figure it out, but in the end,
we scrapped it. Doing everything from scratch turned out to only need
about 2 days.

Because we spent so long on networking and fixing the physics, we did 
not get to upgrade our game much past the requirements, though we did have
some previous upgrades that did not get counted for extra credit before.

The physics improved rapidly after we removed the player model. We were
having trouble programatically finding the paddle in the bullet world.

Improvements:

-The game finally works completely and is relatively fast.
-The physics/bullet is fully functional. It helped to have two people 
working on it.
-We were able to improve latency by using buffered input so that we
could send and receive every frame.
