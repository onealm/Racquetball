All the main files are in the Racquetball folder. 
The main class is Raquetball, along with several subclasses to aid the functioning of the game. 


INSTRUCTIONS:
To build, use ./buildit from the command line, then use ./Racquetball to run.

UserManual.txt details the controls.

Extra:
Improved Camera Controls
Background Music
Particle Effects
A little bit of end condition. We have a timer that counts down and says
"Game Over!", but the game doesn't stop yet.

Our documentation is contained in "Assignment 3.2 Outline.pdf"
